# Pauli's scripts for Chapter 4's biodiversity analyses

This repository was specially created for ease of examination of the biodiversity analyses as reported in chapter 4 of my doctoral thesis. The data are not yet included here, as they are awaiting official publication of the manuscript. The examiners' should have the confidential data files (count tables, metadata and taxonomy tables).

All the scripts are commented and should be manageable to anyone with intermediate R coding skills.

Have fun!

Pauli.
